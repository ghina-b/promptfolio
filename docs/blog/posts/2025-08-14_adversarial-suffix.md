# Adversarial Suffix Attack 
<!-- more -->
Adversarial suffix attack is a type of adversarial attack that targets the suffix of a prompt. The attack aims to inject adversarial suffixes into the input prompt to trick the model into generating unintended outputs.

## Attack Principle

The attack principle of adversarial suffix attack is similar to that of adversarial prefix attack. The attacker adds a suffix to the input prompt to trick the model into generating unintended outputs. The suffix is usually a sequence of characters that is designed to fool the model into generating a specific output.

## How winners used this to their advantage ?
research by [X]  show cases this. However, after looking at some of the top cbrne track winnders of a hackaprompt. Lets analyze a few of them. 

Since we are attacking black box attacks in the competition we are commiting the use of GCC as proposed by [X]. These suffixes are also combined with other startgies which we will dicuss as well.
