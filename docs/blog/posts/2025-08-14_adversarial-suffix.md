# Adversarial Suffix Attack 
<!-- more -->
An adversarial suffix attack is a type of adversarial attack that targets the suffix of a prompt. The attacker appends a malicious suffix to trick the model into generating unintended outputs.

## Attack Principle

The concept is similar to an adversarial prefix attack, but the manipulation is added at the end of the prompt. The suffix is typically a sequence of tokens crafted to steer the model toward a specific output.

## WhiteBox 
Research by [Wallace et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15043) demonstrates this technique GCG.
Gradient‑based optimization (GCG)
Using Greedy Coordinate Gradient, attackers with full model access can calculate token-level gradients to optimize suffixes that maximize the chance of affirmative or harmful responses. This requires access to gradients and model internals.
These suffixes can reliably circumvent content filters and guardrails baked into the model’s alignment logic.

## Black Box 

Transferability of suffixes to black box models, it is not immporssoble alothough it is not widley used as before since it is extremy costly and tyimely. 
However, befrhand , suffixes crafted for one model can still work on others, even closed systems like ChatGPT, Bard, Claude indicating shared vulnerabilities across models.


## Real Life example

A paper [here](https://repello.ai/blog/breaking-metas-prompt-guard-why-your-ai-needs-more-than-just-guardrails) details how it can be used to bypass guardrails. Most furadrails are models and thus they are prone to GCG attacks. We have seen it being used agaist prompt guards by Meta and mant those. 
Jojwa the winner of multiple track in hackaprompt, has attacjly provided the [source code](https://github.com/jyapayne/bypass-prompt-guard-2) for this and checks for prefix and suffix attacks. 


A [paper](https://repello.ai/blog/breaking-metas-prompt-guard-why-your-ai-needs-more-than-just-guardrails) from Repello demonstrates how adversarial techniques can bypass model-based guardrails. Since most guardrails are models themselves, they are inherently vulnerable to GCG-style attacks. This has been observed in the case of Meta’s Prompt Guard and other similar systems. Notably, **Jojwa**, a multiple-track winner in HackAPrompt, released the [source code](https://github.com/jyapayne/bypass-prompt-guard-2) used to attack these models, which includes checks for both prefix and suffix adversarial strategies.
