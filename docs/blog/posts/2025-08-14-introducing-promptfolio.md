summary: What this blog covers and how posts are organized.

Welcome! This blog documents **hands-on experiments** in AI alignment, red-teaming, and jailbreak analysis. Posts are deliberately short and scoped: a single idea, a concrete example, and a takeaway.

## Jailbreak Overview

**Sections youâ€™ll see often**
- _Setup_: model, guardrail, and data slice
- _Attack/Defense_: minimal prompt and expected outcome
- _Result_: what worked, what failed, why
- _Transfer_: does it generalize to other models?

**Why this format**
- Faster iteration and clearer diffs across attempts
- Easier reuse in reports and slide decks
